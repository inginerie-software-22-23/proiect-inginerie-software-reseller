# **Reseller-Web** :cactus:

 Reseller is an application for selling used clothes with an instagram type interface, each user having it's own profile with their items for sale and a system of followers. Our motivation is striving to offer a more sustainable alternative to staying trendy, encouraging people to buy fewer new clothes.
